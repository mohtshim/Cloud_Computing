# DevOps vs GitSecOps vs GitOps

## DevOps
DevOps is a philosophy of the efficient development, deployment and operation of the hightest quality software possible. DevOps allows using various CI/CD pipelines 
without being tied to a specific tool. We can use DevOps with various tools, including cloud configuration as code and supply chain management. DevOps strives to achieve
automation and frequent deployments. DevOps pipelines maintain separate steps for development and seperate steps for operations.

## GitOps
GitOps is an approach that enables developers to automate their infrastructure and manage it alongside their codebase.GitOps involves using the Git which is a open source
version control system.  Git repository stores a visible changelog of the system's state which helps developers to track their and other team members codes

## DevSecOps
DevSecOps (Development security operation) is an organizational models that says that along with the continous intergration and continous deployment all the other members 
working on the projects need to take care of the security of the code or feature that they build. DevSecOps aims to apply security, including scanning, monitoring,
and remediation, acroos the SDLC(software development lifecycle).
