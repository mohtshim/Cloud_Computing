### Install MySQL using Ansible Playbook
For this problem we assume that you have ansible installed on your master node. For this demonstration we are installing mysql on the master node instead of on the worker nodes.
You can configure the worker node and link them to the master node using ssh.

Make a folder on your master node named as "Mysql using ansible". After that write this command 
```
nano playbook.yml
```
This will open a nano editor.
