# Continous Delivery Vs Continous Deployment

## Continous Delivery 
In the continous delivery process all the steps are automatic except that "push of the button". As software is the culmination of choices from several teams,
 travering all the needed steps and modification need to support changes or new features can be winding one. Continous delivery brings all of these steps to
 safetly get changes into production.
 
## Continous Deployment
 In continous deployment all the processes are automatic which includes the passing of the acceptance tests and deplying to the staging area and then after that deploying 
that to the production. It will not ony increase the number of the deployments significantly but also whenever the new artifacts (Code/features which passes through CI)
becomes ready it will be ready for the deployment.
